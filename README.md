# CppProjectTemplate

This is a template project prepared for cmake projects.

## Characteristics
- It is very simple to use. Just copy the CmakeLists.txt in this directory to the project root directory, and then simply set it up as needed.
- Create a virtual path based on the actual path where the file is located
- A project or subproject only needs one CmakeLists.txt file, unless you want to learn cmake
